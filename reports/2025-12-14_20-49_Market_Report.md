## Executive Summary
The UK economy has been slowing down since the summer, with a monthly contraction in GDP of 0.1% in October, and a similar fall in the three-month trend. The delay in the chancellor's budget has added to the uncertainty, causing businesses across production, construction, and services to wait for the outcome. The Jaguar Land Rover cyber-shutdown has also had a continued impact on output. The slowdown is expected to lead to a quarter of stalled growth, and the Bank of England is likely to agree to an interest rate cut. There are multiple identical reports, which may indicate a lack of new information or updates on the situation. The reports all convey the same message, with no conflicting information.
